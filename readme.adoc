= Title

== Part 1 

* Recognition of square numbers up to stem:[50^2]
* Recognition of the first few cubic numbers: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512
* Recognition of powers of two up to stem:[2^20]
* Metric prefixes from pico to terra
* Know that stem:[3.5 * 2.5] is stem:[35 * 25 / 100]
* Squares of numbers such as 2.5 from stem[25^2]. Recognise that the number is between 4 and 9.

== Part 2

* Recognising that stem:[4x] means "four times x"
* commutativity (komutativita) and associativity (asociativita)
* simple examples of removing brackets
* simple examples of adding brackets
* Basic algebra with linear equations e.g. stem:[2x+4] = 12
* Understanding how to manipulate simple equations (adding a constant to both sides, dividing by a constant)

== Part 3

* Negative numbers : adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing
* It's important to recognise that x / x is always one (unless x is zero).
